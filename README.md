# [WIP] cloud-native multi-agent platform with dynamic scaling and full-chain tracking

## Abstract
1. Algorithmic Perspective: The engineering architecture can support continuous iteration of agents, providing canary releases, A/B testing, model parameter management, and execution tracing.
2. Product Perspective: Supports custom extensions based on basic agent patterns, user-level agent isolation, and user-level permission settings.
3. Engineering Perspective: Supports agent service discovery, load balancing for multiple agent instances, resource scaling, and two links: synchronous high-priority and asynchronous fill-in.
4. Stability Perspective: Includes basic engineering features such as rate limiting, retries, monitoring, and degradation.
5. Risk Control Perspective: Supports risk control capabilities such as playback, auditing, interception, and filtering.
6. Security Perspective: Supports security capabilities such as approval for sensitive operations by users, identification of malicious prompt injection, and a code execution sandbox environment.
7. Ecology Perspective: Supports public release of agents and a tool market (user-written, large model-generated).
